# GitHub Workflow Optimization

This directory contains optimized GitHub workflows for the NutriGenius project. The optimizations focus on:

1. **Efficiency** - Reduced redundant operations and improved caching
2. **Security** - Fine-grained permissions and secure practices
3. **Maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns and well-documented workflows
4. **Performance** - Parallelized jobs and optimized dependencies

## Optimized Workflows

- `ci-cd-optimized.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline with build, test, and deployment
- `branch-protection-optimized.yml` - Branch merging rules enforcement
- `codeql-optimized.yml` - Security scanning with CodeQL
- `versioning-optimized.yml` - Version management and release checks
- `dependabot-auto-approve-optimized.yml` - Automated dependency updates

See [OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md](OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md) for detailed information about the improvements made.
