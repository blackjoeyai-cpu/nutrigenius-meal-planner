# Branch Workflow Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the components that have been implemented to enforce the branching workflow:

## Workflow Overview

```
feature/* → dev → release → main
```

## Components Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`

Enforces branch merging rules at the PR level:

- Only allows `release` → `main` merges
- Only allows `dev` → `release` merges
- Prevents `main` and `release` from merging into `dev`

### 2. Git Hooks

**Files**:

- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (installed automatically)
- `scripts/check-branch-source.sh` (helper script)

Prevents direct commits to protected branches (`main`, `release`, `dev`)

### 3. Branch Creation Helper

**File**: `scripts/create-feature-branch.sh`

Script to properly create feature branches from `dev`:

```bash
./scripts/create-feature-branch.sh feature-name
```

### 4. Merge Workflow Helper

**File**: `scripts/merge-workflow.sh`

Interactive script to guide developers through the proper merge sequence

### 5. Documentation

**Files**:

- `docs/branching-strategy.md` - Complete branching strategy documentation
- `docs/github-branch-protection.md` - Instructions for setting up GitHub branch protection
- Updated `README.md` with branching strategy information

### 6. Pull Request Template

**File**: `.github/pull_request_template.md`

Template that reminds developers of the branching strategy when creating PRs

## Setup Instructions

1. The Git hooks are automatically installed when you run:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-branching-rules.sh
   ```

2. Set up branch protection rules in GitHub by following the instructions in:
   `docs/github-branch-protection.md`

3. Use the helper scripts for proper workflow:
   - Create features: `./scripts/create-feature-branch.sh feature-name`
   - Merge properly: `./scripts/merge-workflow.sh`

## Enforcement Levels

This implementation provides multiple levels of enforcement:

1. **Process Documentation** - Clear documentation of the workflow
2. **Client-side Enforcement** - Git hooks prevent direct commits to protected branches
3. **Server-side Enforcement** - GitHub Actions prevent improper merges
4. **UI Guidance** - PR templates remind developers of the rules
5. **Helper Tools** - Scripts to make following the workflow easier

## Verification

To verify the setup is working:

1. Try to commit directly to `dev`, `release`, or `main` - should be blocked
2. Create a PR from `dev` to `main` - should be blocked by GitHub Actions
3. Create a PR from `feature/test` to `dev` - should be allowed
